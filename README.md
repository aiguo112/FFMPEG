# Video Resizing and Lens Correction Tool using FFmpeg

This repository contains a Python script `Lens_Correction.py`  that utilizes FFmpeg to resize videos, perform lens correction, and apply video encoding with hardware acceleration. The script processes video files from an input folder, performs the required transformations, and saves the results in an output folder.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have FFmpeg installed on your system. You can download FFmpeg from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or use package managers like `brew` (macOS) or `apt-get` (Linux).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Place the video files you want to process in the `input_folder` directory.

4. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's root directory.

5. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python process_videos.py
   ```

Replace Python with Python 3 if necessary, depending on your system configuration.

The script will process each video file with the specified transformations and save the results in the output_folder directory.
